dockpulp_repo
--------------

The ``dockpulp_repo`` module can create, update dockpulp repo on dockpulp server. The env running
the playbook need to have dock-pulp installed

pip3 install --no-deps git+https://github.com/release-engineering/dockpulp.git@dockpulp-1.67-1

and three configuration files for dockpulp server

* dockpulp.conf
